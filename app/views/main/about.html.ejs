    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/Tortugas-Consulting-LLC/find.torrent">find.torrent</a>
      is a service to facilitate the discovery and downloading of torrent files
      to a home server or leachbox. The service provides a REST API for
      searching configured torrent RSS feeds and triggering a file download at
      the server. Neither the torrent file nor its indicated content is
      returned to the client; the .torrent file is simply downloaded to a
      configured location at the server. Another service such as Transmission
      needs to be running on the server to process the downloaded .torrents for
      any additional action to be taken.

    <p>
      Since find.torrent was built as a standalone API service, it by itself is
      not sufficient.  It needs applications to be built to consume its
      service.  This site, created
      by <a href="http://matthewmkeeler.com">Matthew M. Keeler</a>, is such a
      client.  It is built on top of <a href="http://nodejs.org">node.js</a>, a
      server side Javascript framework.
